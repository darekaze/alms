## Company Background (WiP)

Name: **Audifactory**

Audifactory was founded in September 2016 as a startup under the PolyU E-business union. Few years before, the headmaster of Audifactory had discovered that the music market is now undergoing a trend of globalization, resulting an inflation of overall demand of the market and other supplementary markets. Along with this business opportunity, Audifactory had initiated several conferences with world’s leading album production company such as Sony and RIAA, and successfully signed a long-lasting contract on business cooperation. (I think you need to be specific to the types of the market, e.g J-Pop only or )This year, Audifactory had initiated a three-month plan on web application design and development to bring an online shopping website for the client, interconnecting with several album production companies.

Now, Audifactory had received the world’s best seller award and other 11 relevant business awards. (No need too much, don’t be too exaggerate). These achievements project the degree of successfulness of the company and dedication of Audifactory in providing the friendly album purchase experience to its clients in every minor aspects of the websites.
