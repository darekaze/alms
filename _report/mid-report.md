## Company Background

Name: **Audifactory**

Audifactory was founded in September 2016 as a startup under the PolyU E-business union. Few years ago, the headmaster of Audifactory, Mr. Frank, was able to discover the music markets are now undergoing a trend of globalization. The markets, especially pop music market, has thus experienced an inflation of overall demand of the market and other supplementary markets. Along with these opportunities, Frank therefore had started an offline album business shop in Hong Kong targeting the local customers.

In mid 2018, while Frank's album business had gained a huge success. He had further realized that there is a soaring growth of internet usage, resulting a change of purchasing behavior from purchasing in traditional stores to online shopping. To maximize the profits of the business, Frank hence decided to follow the current trend by expanding his business online by building an online B2C shop.

Immediately, on September 2018, Audifactory initiates a seasonal plan on building a fully functional web application by recruiting several web developers. By the end of year, Audifactory will be able to provide their business online, and bring clients a satisfactory online shopping experience along with functions of real time searching engine, album previews, and the post delivery service once the purchases are settled.
